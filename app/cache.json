The tech industry has seen more than 240,000 jobs lost in 2023, a total that\u2019s already 50% higher than last year and growing. Earlier this year, mass workforce reductions were driven by the biggest names in tech like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Meta and Zoom. Startups across many sectors also announced cutbacks through the first half of the year. And while tech layoffs slowed down in the summer and fall, it appears that cuts are ramping up yet again.\n\nMany economists have cautioned against fears of a recession, which would seem like a reason for optimism. But the momentum for a tech sector rebound has been slow to build, resulting in tech companies continuing to cut back on their workforces and pivot from a growth mindset to one based on efficiency in the face of stubborn market conditions.\n\nBut tracking these layoffs helps us to understand the impact on innovation, which companies are facing tough pressures and who is available to hire for the businesses lucky to be growing right now. Unfortunately, it also serves as a reminder of the deeply human impact of layoffs and how risk profiles could evolve from here.\n\nBelow you\u2019ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2023, to be updated monthly.

TechCrunch has viewed the email.\n\nSan Francisco and New York were Revel\u2019s last two moped sharing markets. The company will now focus solely on its electric ride-hail and EV charging businesses. Earlier this week, Revel launched its third so-called \u201cSuperhub\u201d in Queens after unveiling a second one in Brooklyn in April. A Revel spokesperson told TechCrunch the company also expects to break ground on a Bay Area charging station soon.\n\nShuttering mopeds represents the end of an era for Revel \u2014 the Brooklyn-based company got its start as a small Bushwick storefront with 68 electric mopeds in 2018. By 2021, Revel had more than 3,000 e-mopeds in New York City and another 3,000 across Washington, D.C., Miami and San Francisco.\n\nThat same year, Revel launched its first Superhub in Brooklyn, started an all-Tesla, all-employee ride-hailing service, and opened (and quietly shut down) an e-bike subscription service. Now the ride-hail service is 500 EVs strong \u2014 made up of Tesla Model Ys and 3s and Kia Niros \u2014 and is available across New York City and parts of northern New Jersey, including to and from La Guardia, JFK and Newark airports.\n\nAs Revel\u2019s other business units grew, demand for its shared micromobility offering began to dip. In his memo to staff, Reig described how \u201cthe service has been strained and ridership isn\u2019t what it used to be.\u201d\n\nRobert Familiar, a spokesperson for the company, told TechCrunch that ridership dipped about 30% in both San Francisco and New York year-over-year from peak summer rides, making the service unsustainable.\n\nRevel already pulled out of Washington, D.C. and Miami in November 2022. Today, the company only has 3,000 mopeds active across both SF and NYC markets.\n\nThe last day of service will be November 18. Revel will send the decommissioned mopeds to recycling facilities in New York and the Bay Area over the next two weeks.\n\nAbout 67 staffers in moped operations will be laid off as a result of the shutdown, and they\u2019ll all be eligible for severance benefits, according to Familiar.

The mission-driven tech company behind the Firefox browser, Pocket reader and other apps is now investing its energy into the so-called \u201cfediverse\u201d \u2014 a collection of decentralized social networking applications, like Mastodon, that communicate with one another over the ActivityPub protocol.\n\nThe idea is to rethink social networking from the ground up.\n\nToday, social networks are often run by large corporations \u2014 like Meta, Snap and Google \u2014 where advertisers pay the bills. This has created a world where modern social networks are profit-driven, and consumer needs aren\u2019t always at the forefront, Mozilla believes. This disconnect between what people want and what today\u2019s networks offer hit an inflection point last year, when billionaire Elon Musk bought Twitter, leading to a surge of interest in alternatives to centralized social networking, including apps like Mastodon and Bluesky.\n\nUnder Musk, Twitter \u2014 now called X \u2014 has prioritized \u201cfree speech\u201d managed by crowdsourced-based moderation. Its policies have resulted in increased hate speech and toxic content on the platform, some studies have shown.\n\nMozilla believes there\u2019s a better way forward and, more importantly, that now is exactly the right time to invest in that path. And, as a wholly owned subsidiary of a nonprofit, the company says it\u2019s not motivated by generating earnings for shareholders or returning a VC investment, allowing it to progress with a collaborative approach where it takes in input from a lot of different voices.\n\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Mozilla Senior Director of Content Carolyn O\u2019Hara explained why Mozilla has taken an interest in the fediverse and Mastodon, specifically, and how it expects to experiment in the months ahead.\n\nFor background, the company announced its plans to enter the fediverse in December 2022 and this May launched a private beta for Mozilla.social, a Mastodon server \u2014 or \u201cinstance\u201d in fediverse parlance \u2014 that will allow consumers to participate in this new form of social networking where problems like misinformation, harassment and issues around worsening mental health are minimized.\n\nThe company\u2019s work on its social efforts is also available publicly on GitHub. (Of interest to technical folks, the company is using a forked version of Elk as its alternative web client for its Mastodon server, which is what gives it its slick look and feel.)\n\nMozilla\u2019s involvement, says O\u2019Hara, came about because the company looked at the history of social media over the past decade and didn\u2019t like what it saw.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s a pretty poor track record by existing companies that are only model motivated by profit and just insane user growth, and are willing to tolerate and amplify really toxic content because it looks like engagement,\u201d she says. \u201c[They] aren\u2019t just putting forward the kind of standards that are good for people, but are just good for their bottom lines.\u201d\n\nPlus, she adds, consumers are now becoming aware of this, which is new.\n\n\u201cConsumers feel that the vibes are off a little bit\u2026these platforms aren\u2019t necessarily working in their best interests, or satisfying them,\u201d O\u2019Hara points out.\n\nFor Mozilla, that discontent presented an opportunity to enter the social networking space and compete for consumers\u2019 attention. In its case, however, the broader goal is to help the fediverse itself gain traction, not just its own Mastodon server.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeking to get, like 2 billion users on our instance. We want people to have choice and agency,\u201d says O\u2019Hara, adding that choice is in line with Mozilla\u2019s values.\n\nHowever, the company is aiming to tackle some of the obstacles that have prevented users from joining and participating in the fediverse so far, including the technical hurdles around onboarding, finding people to follow and discovering interesting content to discuss.\n\nFor starters, users will join the Mozilla.social instance with their Mozilla accounts, which also provides access to the Firefox browser, Mozilla\u2019s VPN, Pocket and other products, simplifying access to its suite of tools. The instance isn\u2019t yet open to the public, but is experimenting with hundreds of users for the time being.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re keeping the number intentionally small and we\u2019re prioritizing the groups that we\u2019re proactively reaching out to,\u201d O\u2019Hara explained. \u201cThe communities we\u2019ve worked with previously will have first access to the private beta, some of which will include folks from the waitlist.\u201d\n\nThe timeline to a public launch isn\u2019t yet determined, as the company plans to experiment with various expansions and features throughout next year.\n\nFor example, Mozilla is currently experimenting with a Discover feed that aims to surface engaging content. Over time, it plans to gather more signals from around the fediverse to determine what sort of content people are interacting with. It also sees a role for its read-it-later app Pocket in this experience, as the app\u2019s primary use case is to store links to articles and other content that people have signaled they want to read.\n\n\u201cWe are planning to open the beta in phases because we want to ensure that we have a content moderation team and other tools that can be scaled relative to the size of the user base. We\u2019re not in a rush as we think it\u2019s important to be deliberate about launching social media tools,\u201d O\u2019Hara says.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of core competency that we brought over from our Pocket experience and other recommendation products that we put together to at least get that engine revving,\u201d notes O\u2019Hara.\n\nInitially, the company is running a Mastodon account, \u201c@Pocket_Recommends@mozilla.social,\u201d where it actively posts recommendations of stories to read. It\u2019s the same sort of content you might find in the Pocket email newsletter, but now distributed on the fediverse.\n\nThe company also wants to address the needs of creators and publishers who want to broaden their audience as it moves forward with its fediverse plans.\n\n\u201cFrom a content discovery standpoint, I\u2019m really interested in how we can seed conversations and seed experiences with really high-quality content \u2014 certainly, editorial publisher content,\u201d says O\u2019Hara. \u201cHow can we get publishers and content providers involved early?\u2026 I think of them as a real constituency for us,\u201d she says. Plus, Mozilla wants to bring in the originators whose posts lead to interesting conversations and keep the network active.\n\nO\u2019Hara says Mozilla is now in active discussions with publishers to understand their needs, including both their social needs and business needs, and how those goals may have changed over the past year. As part of these discussions, Mozilla aims to convince publishers that Mastodon isn\u2019t just another place they have to support, but one that could deliver on their objectives. As it learns from the publishers and other content creators what they want and need, it then intends to use that understanding to build features and drive efforts that can help them reach their audiences.\n\nSo far, what Mozilla has learned is that publishers today feel somewhat resigned and pessimistic about social networks. Twitter isn\u2019t driving much traffic and, even though Instagram Threads appears interesting, Meta specifically said it wasn\u2019t going to prioritize news on that platform. What Mozilla wants to accomplish, then, is to help reconfigure the Mastodon onboarding process so that when someone \u2014 including a publisher or creator \u2014 joins its instance (or the fediverse in general) they\u2019re able to build their audience with more ease.\n\n\u201cThe baseline is just better onboarding, better connecting with accounts and communities,\u201d explains O\u2019Hara. \u201cYou might be interested in spaces where you can have the kinds of conversations that you want to be able to have; trust and safety practices that make you feel safe in order to participate. And I think also then access to content that spurs those conversations and seeds those conversations. And it all being kind of a delightful user experience \u2014 but we\u2019re at the early days of that,\u201d she adds.\n\nAnother avenue of thought is to create spaces within the fediverse where consumers can have civil and direct conversations within smaller communities, instead of shouting into the void, so to speak. As to what that will look like, is less clear. Will it be different instances or just new ways of forming communities, by building out features or experiences? O\u2019Hara couldn\u2019t say, only noting that experimentation will be needed.\n\nImportantly, trust and safety will also be key to Mozilla\u2019s instance. Its content policies indicate strict measures around hate speech, impersonation, self-harm, harassment, misinformation, violent and sexualized content, and more, in addition to illegal content, like CSAM (child sexual abuse material) and promotion of illegal goods.\n\nBut there\u2019s a chance that playing it too safe can make a product less compelling as a Twitter/X alternative. That\u2019s one takeaway, at least, from the recent shutdown of Pebble (formerly T2), a Twitter clone that put trust and safety at the forefront of its development process. The app never gained more than 20,000 users, and the founders now believe that its approach to moderation may have been correct, but it wasn\u2019t a growth driver. In other words, people may say they want to feel safer when participating online, but clearly, that isn\u2019t their only need.\n\nMozilla\u2019s instance, still in private testing, has a small team of moderators that will grow when the instance launches to the public in the coming months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a commitment, it\u2019s beyond foundational for us \u2014 that is the thing that is going to be true about this instance,\u201d O\u2019Hara says of Mozilla\u2019s plans to heavily moderate its space. Though Mozilla will also rely on technology to do some of the work, it wants to make sure the human moderators, \u201cfeel protected, supported and respected for their work,\u201d she adds.\n\n\u201cWe are saying out the gate that this isn\u2019t a neutral platform,\u201d O\u2019Hara stresses. \u201cWe think that that\u2019s often used as this crutch to allow, or even amplify, really toxic content in the name of engagement\u2026 In some cases, platforms aren\u2019t just brave enough to actually just take things down.\u201d\n\nBuilding directly on the fediverse isn\u2019t the only way the company is prompting new forms of social networking. The company has also financially backed a startup, Mammoth, the makers of a third-party app for Mastodon.\n\nMozilla has been leaning into its values around inclusion, dignity, security, agency and community for 25 years, O\u2019Hara says, and those will guide its efforts in the fediverse, as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have rules on how people can engage with one another\u2026it\u2019s the fediverse, you have lots of other places to go if you don\u2019t want to abide by those rules,\u201d she adds.\n\nUsers can provide Mozilla with feedback via @Social @Mozilla.social or by using the hashtag #mozillasocial within the product.", "response": "\ud83c\udf10 Mozilla believes that consumers are craving a new kind of social networking, one that prioritizes trust, safety, and decentralization over the centralized power of Big Tech CEOs.

In addition, Cook confirmed Apple was working on generative AI technologies.\n\nThe features Cook called out aren\u2019t necessarily thought of as AI by consumers, and that may be by design. Cook suggested that Apple doesn\u2019t label the features as \u201cAI\u201d necessarily.\n\n\u201cWe label them as to what their consumer benefit is,\u201d Cook said. \u201cBut the fundamental technology behind it is AI and machine learning.\u201d\n\nPersonal Voice, for example, is an accessibility feature designed to create an automated voice that sounds like you. It\u2019s intended for people who are losing their speaking ability due to various health conditions, including ALS. To use the feature, people first spend 15 minutes reading text prompts into the device\u2019s microphone. Then, using machine learning technologies, the audio is processed locally on their iPhone, iPad or Mac to create their own Personal Voice that sounds like them.\n\nLive Voicemail, meanwhile, is a new consumer-facing feature in iOS 17 that displays a live transcription of a voicemail as it\u2019s being recorded in real time.\n\n\u201cAI is at the heart of these features,\u201d Cook told investors. \u201cAnd then, you can go all the way to the lifesaving features on the watch and the phone like fall detection, crash detection, ECG on the watch.

Here are three aspects you should focus your attention on so you can build your startup without being beholden to anyone.\n\nBuild to solve a specific problem\n\nBootstrapping requires that you involve your clients when building your product roadmap. This is a great way to understand customers\u2019 businesses, problems and blindspots, but it also serves a crucial purpose: It lets you target a specific issue.\n\nOnce you know the problem you need to solve, find out what your customers\u2019 data capabilities are and whether they have the data to solve that issue.

So understand your client\u2019s data formatting before you start thinking about how to receive it. Is the data coming from one or multiple sources? Are there redundancies?\n\nDetermine the quality of their data and data sources. If your client has clean data, you can build APIs to accept that data and leverage it by formatting it so your AI can use it.\n\nAsk yourself if you\u2019re building the technology for a real-world application that companies will need, and if you\u2019re putting every dollar toward providing value for the product, the customer, and the team.", "response": "\ud83d\ude80 Want to build your AI startup without interference from investors?

Since launching in the U.S. earlier this year, the Lemon8 app has only seen around 2.6 million total U.S. downloads, according to new data from app store market intelligence provider Appfigures. This paltry turnout comes despite a sizable influencer marketing push where a number of TikTok creators were praising the app to their followers, after reports indicated the U.S. was possibly moving forward with a TikTok ban.\n\nThe timing did not appear to be coincidental, in other words. If TikTok were about to lose its U.S. audience, ByteDance viewed Lemon8 as a possible backup plan, and it was leveraging the massive TikTok audience to help it grow. Influencers touting the app on TikTok began heavily posting about the app in the first quarter of the year, describing the lifestyle community in glowing, positive terms, like \u201ccute\u201d and \u201caesthetically pleasing,\u201d and comparing the app to a cross between Pinterest and Instagram.\n\nAvailable in Japan as of 2020, and popular in other Eastern markets like Thailand and Indonesia, the app didn\u2019t gain much traction until April 2020, when installs grew from less than a thousand per month to 13,000. The app then reached its first all-time high for monthly downloads when it peaked at 292,000 in July 2021, Appfigures\u2019 data shows. As it expanded in 2022, it peaked again with 1.5 million downloads in July 2022, leading to a total of 10.6 million downloads for the full year.\n\nThis year, Lemon8 began quietly rolling out to the U.S. and U.K., and ByteDance began boosting the app via creator marketing. Insider reported in February, for example, that ByteDance had paid creators to post on Lemon8 to seed its initial U.S. content. The following month, creators began posting to TikTok using similar language in their overly positive videos. Within 24 hours in late March, some 350+ videos matching the search term \u201cLemon8\u201d appeared on TikTok, most of them positive reviews. Some creators even said they were downloading it in case TikTok got banned.\n\nDespite seemingly following a script of sorts, none of the videos we had encountered at the time were marked as sponsored content. This helped to present Lemon8 as an app that was growing organically through word-of-mouth recommendations\n\nBut TikTok didn\u2019t end up banned in the U.S. \u2014 though it has been banned from numerous government devices, at some universities, and in the state of Montana, starting in January 2024. (The latter is being challenged in court.) And even if it is banned or forced to spin out a sale at some point, it doesn\u2019t appear that Lemon8 will be an easy replacement. In addition, most of those installs came from \u201cspikes,\u201d not a rising trend. (Perhaps the TikTok viral effect, in fact.)\n\niOS accounted for most of the U.S. downloads, at 2.5 million, and the app is ranked No. 2 in the Lifestyle category on the U.S. App Store. However, it moves up and down in the Top Overall chart. As of the time the data was collected, it was No. 90 Overall. Today, it\u2019s No. 70 on the Top Apps Chart in the U.S. Though its rankings are decent enough, the total installs are still fairly low for something that\u2019s supposed to slide in to replace TikTok in the event of a ban.\n\nSeptember 2023 was Lemon8\u2019s biggest month in terms of U.S. downloads, as it saw 525,000 new installs. Downloads don\u2019t equate to the number of active users, of course, so Lemon8\u2019s usage is likely even lower. For comparison, TikTok had more than 150 million monthly active users in the U.S. as of March 2023.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s still the possibility that ByteDance could leverage TikTok again to boost Lemon8\u2019s traction in the U.S. For instance, product intelligence firm Watchful.ai discovered a few months ago that TikTok was developing a feature that would allow users to sync their Lemon8 posts to TikTok, and then add sounds and music using TikTok\u2019s editor. TikTok wouldn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on the matter when we asked.\n\nAt the time Lemon8 had roughly 25 million worldwide downloads, per market intelligence firm data.ai.\n\nToday, its biggest markets by total downloads are Japan (7.6 million), Thailand (6.5 million) and the U.S. (2.6 million).", "response": "\ud83d\ude80 TikTok's owner, ByteDance, hoped its Lemon8 app would be a backup plan if TikTok were banned in the U.S., but it has only garnered 2.6 million U.S. downloads so far.

However, its growth hasn't translated to success in the U.S. and U.K.\n\ud83d\udca5 TikTok's potential ban in the U.S. prompted ByteDance to promote Lemon8 through creator marketing. But with TikTok still active, Lemon8's future as a replacement seems uncertain.\n\ud83d\udcf1 The majority of Lemon8's U.S. downloads came from iOS, totaling 2.5 million. While it ranks well in the Lifestyle category, its overall usage and active user base are unclear.\n\ud83d\udca1ByteDance might still use TikTok to boost Lemon8's U.S. growth.

And that, essentially, is because most chat apps default to using peer-to-peer connections \u2014 meaning you and the person you\u2019re talking to connect directly to each other \u2014 to improve the quality of the calls.\n\nThat is not necessarily a huge risk. But, according to experts, it\u2019s not clear that users are aware of this potential privacy issue, or are aware of how calls over popular messaging apps like Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Apple\u2019s FaceTime, Viber, Snapchat and Threema work.\n\n\u201cEven for users with more extreme threat models, I think that most of them aren\u2019t aware of the fact that calls can leak their IP address to the person that they\u2019re calling,\u201d Cooper Quintin, a security researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told TechCrunch.\n\nMatthew Green, a cryptography teacher at Johns Hopkins University, said on X (formerly Twitter) that he did not realize Signal revealed IP addresses in calls between contacts. Green also added that it\u2019s likely many users are also not aware.\n\n\u201cAnytime someone sets a feature as a non-default, I assume 95% of users never touch it. When they put it under the \u2018Privacy\u2019 settings menu, I raise my expectation to 99%. But Privacy > Settings > Advanced? I\u2019d bet we\u2019re up to 99.8% now,\u201d Green wrote, referring to the option to turn off peer-to-peer calls completely off on Signal.\n\nIP addresses don\u2019t reveal your precise location, but can still present a risk to users who have their IP address exposed, especially for victims of abuse, according to Runa Sandvik, a digital security expert and founder of Granitt, a startup that helps defend at-risk users. IP addresses can also be linked to a person\u2019s internet activity, which can subject users to surveillance.\n\nExperts agree that there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution, and that this is a complicated problem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough call about what would be the better way to do it,\u201d said Quintin, who has studied the security and privacy of several messaging apps. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any great way to do this that perfectly protects everybody\u2019s privacy all the time. People calling each other can either reveal their IP address to each other. Or the proxy servers for the encrypted messaging app can have a list of everybody who\u2019s calling everybody. And that can be potentially accessed by law enforcement.\u201d\n\nTelegram\n\nIn October, we reported that Telegram leaks users\u2019 IP addresses during calls made between contacts. Security researcher Denis Simonov, also known as n0a, made a relatively easy-to-use tool that is designed to capture the IP address of the other person during a call, as long as the two callers are in each other\u2019s contacts. Telegram reveals users\u2019 IP addresses in that circumstance because calls between contacts default to being peer-to-peer with the goal of having better \u201cquality and reduced latency,\u201d according to Telegram spokesperson Remi Vaughn.\n\n\u201cThe downside of this is that it necessitates that both sides know the IP address of the other (since it is a direct connection). Unlike on other messengers, calls from those who are not your contact list will be routed through Telegram\u2019s servers to obscure that,\u201d Vaughn told TechCrunch.\n\nOther apps work in a similar way, and can also leak IP addresses. Below, we go through some of the most popular chat and calling apps in the world and break down how they work and under what circumstances they can reveal IP addresses between callers. (Note: all instructions below are for the iOS apps.)\n\nSignal\n\nIn a blog post about the launch of video calls on Signal from 2017, Signal\u2019s founder Moxie Marlinspike wrote that from then on, Signal would establish a peer-to-peer connection in calls between contacts. If not, Signal would still be relaying calls through its servers, which results in masking the caller\u2019s IP addresses.\n\n\u201cBy default, Signal will only attempt to establish a P2P [peer-to-peer] connection if you are initiating the call or if you are receiving a call from someone in your contacts. If you are receiving a call from someone not in your address book, Signal will relay that call through the Signal service,\u201d Marlinspike wrote.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that Signal\u2019s messages and calls are end-to-end encrypted by default, meaning that the company cannot see or listen to the contents of any communication.\n\nJust like Telegram, which has an option to turn off peer-to-peer by default and thus avoid leaking users\u2019 IP addresses, Signal offers that option too.\n\nIf you want to completely eliminate the risk of exposing your IP address on Signal, tap on your avatar on the top left, tap on Settings, then Privacy, scroll all the way down to Advanced, and turn on the \u201cAlways Relay Calls\u201d option.\n\nSignal chose to make peer-to-peer calling the default between contacts to give users calls that have better audio quality and less latency, according to Signal\u2019s president Meredith Whittaker.\n\n\u201cIf we had relay as the default it would not work well for many people in various parts of the world. Peer to peer is faster and more performant, which in many cases is the difference between the feature working or not,\u201d Whittaker told TechCrunch. \u201cSo ultimately it\u2019s not just a performance issue, it\u2019s a \u2018will this work for people at all?\u2019 issue.\u201d\n\nAccording to Signal\u2019s senior technical writer Josh Lund, what Signal is doing is now the industry\u2019s standard. \u201cUsing peer to peer connections is just how Voice over IP apps work. And I think that\u2019s a really important point to represent accurately,\u201d Lund said.\n\nWhatsApp\n\nMeta-owned WhatsApp, one of the most popular chat apps in the world (if not the most), is designed to switch between peer-to-peer and relayed calls automatically, WhatsApp said.\n\nThat choice depends on call latency and which option provides stronger call quality. Sometimes that\u2019s peer-to-peer, sometimes relaying the call through the WhatsApp server is better, according to WhatsApp. Just like Signal, WhatsApp messages and calls are end-to-end encrypted by default.\n\nAs of this writing, users don\u2019t have the option to turn off peer-to-peer calls like they do on Signal. But, according to WhatsApp, the company has been rolling out an optional feature \u2014 already present in beta versions \u2014 that would give WhatsApp users the ability to hide their IP address from other people they\u2019re calling, which the company plans to completely roll out in the coming weeks.\n\nBy turning on this feature, all calls will go through WhatsApp servers. In other words, WhatsApp will soon give users the ability to completely opt-out of peer-to-peer calls, just like Signal and Telegram do now.\n\nFaceTime\n\nApple\u2019s FaceTime, which is also end-to-end encrypted by default, uses peer-to-peer connections for every call, according to Apple\u2019s security documentation.\n\n\u201cWhen the user answers the call, the audio is seamlessly transmitted from the user\u2019s iPhone using a secure peer-to-peer connection between the two devices,\u201d Apple says in the guide.\n\nThere is no option to turn this peer-to-peer connection off. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFacebook Messenger\n\nFacebook Messenger makes it clear in a help page that \u201cin audio or video calls between only two people, your IP address will be shared with the other person\u2019s device to establish a peer-to-peer connection.\u201d\n\n\u201cA peer-to-peer connection uses your IP address to connect directly with the person you\u2019re calling to help improve the audio and video quality of your call. While this happens in the background, it may be possible for the other person to discover your IP address,\u201d the page reads.\n\nMeta spokesperson Alex Dziedzan told TechCrunch that \u201cif you answer a call on Messenger, you will share your IP address. You can\u2019t turn off calling as a feature.\u201d\n\nSnapchat\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how Snapchat calls work, and whether they leak IP addresses or not. There\u2019s no reference to the use of peer-to-peer calls or whether calls expose IP addresses anywhere on Snapchat\u2019s official website. Snapchat did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nViber\n\nOn its website, Viber says that \u201cpeer-to-peer is only used in 1-on-1 calls on Viber.\u201d And that users can choose to turn peer-to-peer communication off so that \u201cyour IP address is no longer used in your Viber calls, but it will reduce your call quality.\u201d\n\nTo turn off peer-to-peer calls, go to More on the bottom-left corner with the three dots, tap on Settings, then Privacy, scroll down and turn off the toggle for \u201cUse Peer-to-Peer.\u201d\n\nViber did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThreema\n\nThe privacy-minded messaging app Threema works similarly to Signal. Threema spokesperson Julia Weiss told TechCrunch that calls between \u201cunverified contacts\u201d are \u201calways routed through the Threema server in order to obscure the IP address.\u201d\n\nUsers who verify each other, either by scanning their QR code or Threema ID in real life or through contact discovery \u2014 a system that allows users to link their Threema ID to their phone numbers or email addresses \u2014 will have their calls be peer-to-peer by default.\n\nAnd, like Signal and Telegram, Threema users can turn off peer-to-peer by default, making all calls go through its relay servers.\n\nTo turn that option on, go to Settings, Threema Calls, and then turn on \u201cAlways Relay Calls.\u201d\n\nRead more on TechCrunch:", "response": "\ud83d\udea8 Attention: Apps like Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, and FaceTime could be revealing your IP address to callers, increasing the risk to your privacy.\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Many users are unaware of this potential privacy issue or how calls over popular messaging apps work, says Cooper Quintin, a security researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\n\ud83d\udd12 IP addresses can expose users to surveillance and pose a risk to victims of abuse, according to experts.\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 Experts agree there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, as either revealing IP addresses to each other or having proxy servers track all calls both have their own drawbacks.\n\n\ud83d\udcde Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Apple's FaceTime, Viber, Snapchat, and Threema all have different ways of handling calls and potentially revealing IP addresses.\n\n\ud83d\udd12 If you want to protect your IP address on Signal, you can turn on the \"Always Relay Calls\" option under the Advanced settings menu.\n\n\ud83d\udcde WhatsApp is rolling out a feature to give users the option of hiding their IP addresses during calls.\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Facebook Messenger shares IP addresses in peer-to-peer calls, and you cannot turn off calling as a feature.\n\n\ud83d\udcde The call functioning and IP address exposure of Snapchat, Viber, and Threema remain unclear.\n\n\ud83d\udd12 To enhance privacy on Viber, users can turn off peer-to-peer calls in the app settings.\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Threema allows users to have calls routed through their server for added privacy.\n\nInterested in learning more?

Still, a universal treatment for all cancers? That\u2019s got to be worth a second look. It\u2019s also a great opportunity to walk you through the thought process of an investor.\n\nTwo green flags\n\nFirst off, let\u2019s take a look at what really works about the company\u2019s pitch.\n\nA complex topic made accessible\n\nIt\u2019s clear the CancerVAX team has some serious storytelling chops. Here\u2019s the main video pitch for this campaign in which the company\u2019s CEO, Ryan Davies, explains what they\u2019re working on:\n\nA pitch for a cancer vaccine can very easily turn into a cavalcade of technical language and complex science. I commend the CancerVAX team for making a tremendously complex topic extremely accessible, even for people who don\u2019t really know what cancer is or how it works.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the company has an earlier version of this pitch on its YouTube channel. Suffice it to say, I\u2019m happy CancerVAX hired someone with a decent camera because the video embedded above is significantly better.\n\nPowerful, emotive storytelling\n\nIn the pitch video above, Davies plays one of the most powerful cards known to storytelling: Make a story hit close to home. It\u2019s easier to encourage your audience to empathize with a single family who has lost their four-year-old son in a hail of bullets than it is to spur them to absorb the tragedy that 3,500 children have died in a conflict.\n\n\u201cI have six daughters, and two sons. Applying these same statistics to my family, one of my sons and two of my daughters will get some form of cancer in their lifetime. And another personal note, my father got cancer at the age of 47,\u201d he says, drawing us into the narrative. \u201cThat was scary. My wife\u2019s father got cancer in his early 70s. And my grandfather died from cancer. I\u2019m guessing that you probably know someone that has cancer, too. This is a disease that truly affects all of us.\u201d\n\nI would argue that perhaps the company is laying it on a bit thick \u2014 there\u2019s a thin line between rousing storytelling and emotional manipulation \u2014 but it\u2019s refreshing to see someone who isn\u2019t afraid to really go into the story. Very well done.\n\nAs a startup, you can use this lesson to think about how you can make your own story feel \u201creal\u201d and impactful.\n\nFour red flags\n\nCancerVAX has a lot of things going for it. From a journalist and investor perspective, though, the campaign raises some pretty serious questions. Specifically, there are three major issues that would dissuade me from investing in this campaign: the team, the technology, and the same red flag that the investment community saw with Theranos. . . .", "response": "\ud83d\udd0dNew edition of Pitch Deck Teardown: Analyzing CancerVAX campaign on StartEngine! \n\ud83d\udd2cI wasn't invited to review, but a universal cancer treatment caught my attention.
